    "\n",
    "## 1. What is Python?\n",
    "**Python** is a language we use to give instructions to a computer. Just like speaking English or Spanish helps us communicate with people, Python lets us communicate with a computer to solve problems or perform tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key concepts:\n",
    "- **Code**: Instructions written in Python for the computer to follow.\n",
    "- **Syntax**: The rules for writing Python code so the computer understands it.\n",
    "- **Statements**: Individual instructions in your code, like telling the computer to print something or calculate a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "- [Python Beginner's Guide](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/): the official Python website explains what Python is and why it's used, with links to tutorials and guides."

    "## 2. Google Colab Interface\n",
    "In this course, we'll use **Google Colab** to write and run our Python code. Google Colab is a free online platform that lets you write and run Python code in your web browser. The nice thing is that you don't need to install anything on your computer to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of Google Colab:\n",
    "- **Code cells**: Where you write and run your Python code.\n",
    "- **Text cells**: Where you can write explanations or notes in plain text (like this one!).\n",
    "- **Run cells**: You can run the code by clicking the \"play\" button next to a code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code cells \n",
    "In Google Colab, you write a **block of code** (a set of instructions) inside a **code cell**. <br>\n",
    "Each line in a code cell usually contains a **statement** (an individual instruction). <br>\n",
    "When you run the code cell, the computer processes each line one by one, from top to bottom.<br>\n",
    "You can use `#` to write **comments** on code cells. Anything you add after a # will be ignored."

    "## 3. Introduction to Variables and Data Types\n",
    "In Python, **variables** are used to store information that you want to use later. Think of them like containers that hold data.\n",
    "1. **Naming variables**\n",
    "You can name your variables almost anything, but there are some important rules:\n",
    "- It can only use letters, numbers, and underscores (`_`) character.\n",
    "- It can't begin with a number.\n",
    "- It cannot use Python's reserved keywords (like `print`, `if`, or `while`).\n",
    "2. **Assigning variable**\n",
    "To assign a value (like a number, text, or data) to a variable, use the `=` symbol. This tells Python to \"store\" the value in the variable.\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "my_variable_name = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Type of data\n",
    "- **Integers**: `int` are whole numbers (e.g., 3, -5, 10).\n",
    "- **Floats**: `float` are numbers with decimals (e.g., 3.14, -2.5, 0.001).\n",
    "- **Strings**: `str` are text (e.g., \"Hello\", \"Python is fun!\"). Strings must be enclosed in \"\".\n",
    "- **Booleans**: `bool` are True or False values."
